The Basics of Blockchain Technology (500 words)

Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers in a way that makes the records hard to alter. Instead of a single company or server owning the data, many independent participants (called nodes) maintain copies of the ledger. This design removes a single point of failure, makes data tampering easier to detect, and allows participants who do not fully trust each other to still agree on a shared history.

Data is stored in blocks. A block is a container that typically includes a list of recent transactions, a timestamp, a reference to the previous block, and a cryptographic digest called a hash. The hash is produced by running the block’s contents through a one-way mathematical function. If anyone changes even one bit in the block, the hash changes dramatically. Because each block points to the hash of the previous block, blocks form a chain. Changing a past block would break the links, revealing tampering unless most participants agree to rewrite history.

Consensus mechanisms coordinate how nodes agree on which new block becomes part of the chain. Two common approaches are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). In PoW, miners compete to solve a difficult puzzle; the first valid solution earns the right to add the next block and receive a reward. In PoS, validators lock up (stake) cryptocurrency; one is chosen to propose the next block, and others attest to it. Both aim to make attacks expensive and honest participation worthwhile.

Key properties of blockchains include decentralization, transparency, and immutability. Decentralization means no single authority controls the ledger. Transparency means anyone can inspect the history on public networks. Immutability means it is very hard to change finalized records, which increases trust in the data. Smart contracts—programs stored and executed on the blockchain—allow automatic enforcement of rules, enabling applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) without intermediaries.

Blockchains have uses beyond cryptocurrency. In supply chains, they can track goods from origin to store shelves, improving traceability and reducing fraud. In digital identity, they can let people prove attributes without revealing all personal data. In healthcare, they may support audit trails for data sharing. Governments experiment with land registries and voting pilots. Not every use case benefits, though; blockchains can be slower and more expensive than traditional databases, and public chains face scalability and energy concerns (especially with PoW).

In summary, a blockchain is a shared, append-only ledger organized as linked blocks and secured by cryptography and consensus. Its design reduces reliance on central authorities and enables new programmable applications, but trade-offs—performance, cost, and complexity—mean it should be chosen when tamper-resistance and openness are worth the overhead.



## 2. Prompts
### Prompt A: Straightforward
Summarize the following 500-word technical article, "The Basics of Blockchain Technology," for first- and second-year undergraduate students.

Constraints:
- Output length: 120–150 words.
- Plain, simple language; define any necessary jargon in parentheses.
- Cover: what blockchain is, how blocks+hashes+chain work, what consensus is (briefly), key properties (decentralization, immutability), one real-world use, and one limitation.
- End with exactly 2 short bullet takeaways.

#### ARTICLE:
##### ChatGPT:
Blockchain is a digital record-keeping system where information is stored in units called blocks. Each block holds data and a unique identifier called a hash (a fixed-length code made from the block’s content). Every new block links to the previous one using its hash, creating a secure chain of blocks. Because changing one block would break the whole chain, the system is hard to tamper with.

To keep everyone honest, blockchains use consensus (agreement among many computers) instead of relying on one central authority. This makes the system decentralized (no single controller) and immutable (data can’t easily be changed). A real-world use is cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. However, one limitation is that blockchain can be slow and energy-intensive.

Blockchain stores data in linked, tamper-resistant blocks.

It is decentralized but can face speed and energy issues.

##### Claude:
I notice that you've provided the structure for a 500-word technical article titled "The Basics of Blockchain Technology," but the actual article content appears to be missing - there's just "[Insert Article Here]" where the article should be.

To provide you with an accurate 120-150 word summary that meets all your specific constraints, I would need the actual article content to work with.

However, if you'd like, I could create a sample summary based on what a typical "Basics of Blockchain Technology" article might cover, following your exact requirements. Or if you can provide the actual article text, I'd be happy to summarize that specific content for your undergraduate students.

Which would you prefer - should I wait for the actual article, or would a sample summary based on common blockchain basics be helpful?


### Prompt B: Tabular
Read the article "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" and produce a compact table plus a one-sentence summary.

Requirements:
- Table columns: Concept | In simple words (≤15) | Why it matters | Example
- Include these rows in order: Ledger, Block, Hash, Chain, Consensus (PoW/PoS), Decentralization, Immutability, Smart Contracts, Real-world Uses, Limitations.
- Keep each cell concise.
- After the table, add one sentence summarizing the overall idea for undergraduates.
